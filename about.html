This page describes <b>Websheets</b>, a system for creating
and solving programming exercises.
<p>Try the following Websheet out by filling in the blanks. After
solving it or making three incorrect submissions, you can also see the 
author's solution. 
<div class='websheet-stub'>cpp/var-expr/hello</div>
<h3>Components of the Websheets System</h3>
<p>
<b>Students</b> can use the <a href=".">problem-solving interface</a>
to start practicing their Java and C++ skills. A <a href="list.php">list of all Websheet problems</a> 
is also available.
<p>
<b>Exercise Authors</b> can use the <a href="editor.php">editor</a> to create and edit Websheet problems</a>.
There is an <a href="manual.html">author's manual</a>.
<p>
<b>Teachers</b> can 
see their students' grades on the <a href="grades.php">grades page</a>
once the students grant them permission to see the grades on the <a href="settings.php">settings page</a>.
<p>
<b>Hackers and Administrators</b> can read the
<a href="https://github.com/daveagp/websheets">installation guide and source code</a>
of the system, which is open-source, and see a simple example of
<a href="embed.html">embedding websheets in webpages</a>.

<h3>About</h3>
Websheets has been developed since 2013 by <a href='http://ints.io/daveagp'>David Pritchard</a>,
supported by Princeton University, the University of Southern California,
and the University of Waterloo. It has been used by over 1000 students.
<p>Please send any positive feedback, bug reports, or feature
requests by email to <tt>daveagp@gmail.com</tt>. We are also looking to 
measure the effects of different types of scaffolded exercises in the classroom.
<p>We welcome any sort of code contributions: new language support, new features, interface improvements, etc.
It is easiest to incorporate work proposed as a <a href="https://github.com/daveagp/websheets">GitHub pull request</a>.
<p>Websheets was presented at the conference <a href='http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2754863'>ITiCSE 2015</a> 
(<i>Pritchard, David. Websheets: A Templated Online Coding Exercise System, Proc. 15th ITiCSE, p.335, 2015</i>). <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YhJvl9ZPEUkMwyIHey4-PF7vYDk-zekTL5xXt8ryiDo/edit?usp=sharing">Here are the slides</a>.

<h3>Authentication Informatio</h3>

Websheets uses secure third-party authentication. So students need
an account on Google, Facebook, or GitHub; they log in via that
provider. Websheets will never know what their password is.

<p>If you install Websheets on your own server, you can replace this
with <a href="http://hybridauth.sourceforge.net/userguide.html">any other HybridAuth provider</a> including OpenID, or any other PHP
authentication mechanism (see the <a href="https://github.com/daveagp/websheets/blob/master/README">README</a>). Upon request
we can add other HybridAuth providers to our hosted mirror on the University of Waterloo's server.

<p>Students grant a teacher the permission to look at their grades by
visiting the settings page. Alternatively, if you run your own
Websheets mirror, you can access all of the grades.
