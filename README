MIRRORS

http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~cos126/websheets/index.php (Java 7)
http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/websheets/index.php (Java 8)
(note, they do not share a database)

Note, you can link to a particular exercise with
.../index.php#NameAge
or a group of exercises with 
.../index.php?group=HelloWorld+NameAge+NextYear#NameAge

INSTALLATION

Here is an abbreviated version of how to install websheets on your computer.

1) Install https://github.com/cemc/safeexec (follow instructions therein)
2) Install https://github.com/daveagp/java_jail (follow instructions therein)
3) Clone the websheets repo as well as its submodules
4) Setup config.json (see below)
5) Create the db table (optional. see below)
6) Make more exercises (optional. see below)

==Step 4==
config.json is a json-formatted file, variously loaded by php and 
python, that contains all the secrets that are specific to your setup. 
It should
look like this:

{
 "safeexec-executable-abspath":"/absolute/path/to/.../safeexec/safeexec",
 "java_jail-abspath":"/absolute/path/to/.../java_jail/",
 "hybridauth-base_url":
         "http://your-website.../websheets/hybridauth/hybridauth/index.php",
 "db-host": "...",
 "db-user": "...",
 "db-password": "...",
 "db-database": "...",
 "facebook-id": "your facebook api id",
 "facebook-secret": "your facebook api secret key",
 "google-id":"your google api id",
 "google-secret":"your google api secret key"
}

you can delete facebook-* if you don't want to use facebook,
and google-* if you don't want to use google

==Step 5==
Here's the db table format:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ws_history` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `user` varchar(100) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `problem` varchar(100) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `submission` varchar(5000) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `result` mediumtext COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `time` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `passed` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `meta` text COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `user` (`user`,`problem`,`passed`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=1;

==Step 6==
To define more exercises, follow the examples in the "exercises" directory. 
They are key-value string pairs, written as python modules only because this 
makes less escaping necessary.

Note that, as of writing (May 2014), there is no proper documentation on
how to define exercises. Also, certain aspects, especially spacing issues
around "default", "fake" or "hidden" code, are very ungainly. Cleaning this
interface up is ongoing work.

THANKS
